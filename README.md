## Task Description
1. Project Setup:
 - Start a new Angular project.
 - Select any public API that supports text-based queries.
2. Feature Implementation:
 - Develop a typeahead search with search optimizations (e.g., debounce, switchMap).
 - Render results using a virtual scroller with batch-based pagination.
 - Save typeahead queries in the store (NgRx), optimized to include only meaningful queries (e.g., those triggering results).
 - Suggest past queries from the store for subsequent searches (consider optimizations like word breakdown).
3. Code Expectations:
 - Use store actions, effects, reducers, and selectors.
 - Incorporate services and interceptors where needed.
